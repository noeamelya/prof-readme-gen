# Professional README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer packageLinks to an external site. 


  * When a user is prompted for information about the application repository 
    - then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with: The title of my project 
      Sections entitled:
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Addition info
    * When a user enters the project title
      - then it is displayed as the title of the README
    * When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions 
      - then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
    * When a user choose a license for their application
      - then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled **License** that explains which license the application is covered under
    * When a user enters their GitHub username 
      - then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile
    * When a user enters their email address 
      - then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions
    * When a user clicks on the links in the **Table of Contents** then they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
